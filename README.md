AlphaFamImpute
===============

AlphaFamImpute is a genotype calling, phasing, and imputation algorithm for large full-sib families in diploid plants and animals which supports individuals genotyped with SNP array or GBS data. The approach draws heavily on single and multi-locus iterative peeling (as in AlphaPeel). It also has been inspired by work outside our group such as hs-phase (Ferdosi et al. 2014), and magicimpute (Zheng et al. 2018). AlphaFamImpute was written by Andrew Whalen, and is currently being supported by Andrew Whalen and Steve Thorn.
